To run this program:

In eclipse:
Run as -> Run configurations -> Arguments

type "-h" to get help.
type "-eh2" to get top 3 results sorted from column 2 value 

————————————————————————————————————————————
The example below shows how it works, but it is abit confusing, but we picked the second way coz its an individual assignment: 
Two possible outcomes: 
1.
each result has two values in the same row.
which means that we sort by its total: value1 + value2.
but adding up the values sometimes doesnt make sense unless they are related.

2.
pick the top result in one column no matter the value in another column,
then return the value in another column together as result anyway.

// sort all columns to get the top 3 values from each column, and compare again to get the top 3 values out of all columns
// get the final rows , and return all values in the row for each column.

//sort all columns to get the top 3 values from each column
//get the final rows, and compare again to get the top 3 values of sum out for all columns.

As an example, for the following input file:

row,column,eh2,eh3,eh4

1,1,3.5,5.6,0.63
1,2,5.2,5.5,0.01
1,3,1.1,5.1,0.85
1,4,3.8,5.8,0.92
1,5,3.8,5.2,0.54

For sorting on columns ‘eh2’ and ‘eh4’ The following output should be produced:

output:

- row: 1

  column: 2 

  data: eh2=5.2 eh4=0.01

- row: 1

  column: 4 

  data: eh2=3.8 eh4=0.92

- row: 1

  column: 5 

  data: eh2=3.8 eh4=0.54
